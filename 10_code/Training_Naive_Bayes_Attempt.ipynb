we succeeded in having his weight decrease from its value of 189 lbs   to as low as 177 1 2 lbs   coincident with this   his clinical condition improved markedly   and he became fully ambulatory   given the difficulties in trying to assess the exact mechanism by which his heart failure had occurred   we proceeded to cardiac catheterization on 4 1 93   at the time of this study   the right atrial pressure was 1   the pa pressure 32 10   and the mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 10   there was a 40 50 mm peak to peak gradient across the aortic valve   a mean gradient of 40   and a calculated valve area of 0 5 cm squared   using a cardiac output of 3 4 liters per minute   left ventriculography demonstrated marked left ventricle dilatation   there was mild mitral regurgitation   a posterior basil aneurysm   and akinesis of the apex   septum   and inferior walls   the anterior lateral wall was severely hypokinetic   and the posterior lateral wall moderately kinetic   the aortic valve was calcified with reduced excursion consistent with his aortic stenosis   a dominant right coronary artery had an 80  proximal stenosis   and was then occluded at the acute margin   a large right ventricular marginal branch did fill the saphenous vein graft in a retrograde fashion   the posterior descending artery had an 80  stenosis proximal to the insertion of the graft   the left anterior descending was proximally occluded   and the left circumflex had a 90  stenosis in the first marginal branch   and 90  stenosis distally in other branches   the saphenous vein graft to the right ventricular acute marginal and posterior descending artery was patent with good runoff   the saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending had a minor plaque at the distal anastomosis   the saphenous vein graft to three distal marginal branches was patent with good flow   certainly   the cardiac catheterization was consistent with severe aortic stenosis in the presence of profound left ventricular systolic dysfunction   these findings were reviewed with dr  patella and together we decided that conservative therapy would be the appropriate first choice in mr  breun  s management   his advanced age   prior cardiac surgery and advanced left ventricular dysfunction   together with his chronic renal insufficiency   would certainly complicate to an enormous degree any undertaking as risky as redo surgery for aortic valve replacement   percutaneous aortic valvuloplasty   on the other hand   would only be a temporary procedure and did not seem necessary even for transient symptomatic relief given his marked improvement following a rather conventional course of intravenous diuretics   it is very unlikely that we will offer mr  breun aortic valve replacement surgery in the future   he seems to agree with this particular approach as the quality of life has become very important and appropriate issue for him   he is looking forward to returning home and going back to work on a part time basis at the local pharmacy   we will see how far we can get with medical therapy although mr  wierst and his family clearly understand the long term

study was performed which clearly demonstrated frank aspiration and poor swallowing mechanism by the patient   several ng tubes were placed and the patient kept pulling the ng tubes out because his mental status was not completely cleared   the patient was sustained on iv fluids with d10 and multivitamins   thiamine   and folate   he was kept npo given his history of aspiration and further attempts were made to fee the patient and finally as the patient  s mental status cleared he was responsive to having an ng feeding tube placed with jevity feeds started   other options were considered including a peg placement as well as surgical placement of a gastrostomy tube   however   it was felt that less aggressive measures with an ng tube would be prudent at this juncture given the patient  s poor prognosis for the future   the family was involved in making decisions regarding the patient  s nutritional status and originally felt that iv fluids alone should be used   however   finally decided that some sort of feeding should be undertaken and the ng tube was the initial thought   it is felt that if the ng tube does not work out the patient may need to be reassessed for potential placement of a gastrostomy tube   however   it is felt by all parties involved that the aggressive end may also present significant risk to this patient given that an operative procedure may be dangerous and patient has shown significant desaturation and uncooperativeness with his first egd on admission   4  pulmonary   the patient had a clear chest x ray other than a right lower lobe opacity consistent with scarring vs  fat pad which has been chronic on admission   the patient was saturating well throughout the initial part of the stay until he had the upper gi bleed on 9 22 93 at which time he also had significant aspiration of vomitus and was considered to have a probable aspiration pneumonia but with vague findings on chest x ray   the chest x ray cleared rather rapidly and on the third day post aspiration was consistent with the original admission x ray   however   after aspiration given that the patient had a white count bump from under 10 000 to 16 000 it was felt that he should be started on antibiotics and he was started on ceftriaxone and clindamycin for a total 10 day course for presumptive aspiration pneumonia   the patient was afebrile throughout this period and tolerated antibiotics well and pneumonia appeared to resolve   no organism was ever cultured out of the sputum   5  gu   the patient was not entirely responsive to using urinal or the bathroom and at times was incontinent   it was thought that a foley catheter would be most appropriate and he seemed to tolerate this well   he had at one point the possibility of uti but he was asymptomatic and on rechecking the urine there was no sign of urinary tract infection   the patient continued to be asymptomatic   6  neurological   the patient originally was almost completely non responsive at least to verbal command but as his hospital course progressed he became somewhat more alert and towards the end of his hospital course was much more alert and oriented usually only times two and was difficult   the patient was much more cooperative towards the end of his stay and much more appropriate   however   he did not seem to fully comprehend the fact that he had cancer and that he would not be able to swallow things by mouth   these issues were explained to him repeatedly   however   he did not appear to comprehend them from day to day   psychiatry evaluated the patient and felt that he was not competent to decide his own affairs   7  social issues   the wife had obtained health proxy prior to this admission and it was felt that since the patient was not competent to make decisions on his own the wife would make decisions regarding the health status and treatment of the patient   it was decided the patient  s code status would not be dnr   dni   8  dental   the patient was noted to have very few teeth and it was noted that none appeared viable and it was felt that since he would be undergoing xrt in the future that his teeth should be removed to avoid radiation necrosis in the future when he received his xrt   he underwent extraction of all his teeth on 9 21 93 tolerating the procedure well initially but then developed the ileus as noted above and

right upper lobe and one left upper lobe nodule and a follow up chest x ray on 09 27 93 showed resolution of these previous nodular shadows   a faint nodule remained in the left upper lobe and it was felt that this is probably not any metastatic disease and not of concern   however   it was suggested that follow up chest x ray may be taken to insure that these densities resolve   operative

 and in the setting of recurrent spiking fevers and worsening renal function   he was transferred to the intensive care unit on the 17th of february   1997   in the intensive care unit   his chest tube continued to have massive volume output   and an increasing number of white cells with a left shift were noted in the transudated fluid   he has not been considered as a candidate for a tipps or

prilodol   sinemet and opuputine   allergies  he had no known drug allergies   hospital course and treatment  the patient was admitted and started on ampingent intravenously   there was a question of aspiration pneumonia so he was switched from ampicillin pen g to aspiration pneumonia   he was continued on his parkinson  s medications   a head ct was scheduled to rule out interval increase in subdurals   head ct results show full bilateral acute hemorrhage in his subdural hematomas   now with slight midline shift   dr  factor agreed he would review the cts and follow the patient while in house   he was seen by urology   who suggested to leave the catheter in for now in the setting of doubt ms   he was seen by neuro   who felt that the subdural hemorrhages should be followed and treated conservatively as well as precautions for fall and no further intervention was warranted given risk of re bleed which is quite high with his atrophic changes   the patient  s mental status improved greatly after the onset of intravenous antibiotics   doing much better   was much more awake and alert and the plan was to possibly send him home on po antibiotics and full arnsperni health services   bedside swallow test was done which showed him to have some aspiration   he did have some recurrent fevers and his intravenous antibiotic were continued   thus   he was considered ready for discharge   he again became much more somnolent   there was a question whether he had re aspirated   he again was becoming increasing febrile and somnolent while the patient was awaiting a chest x ray and further evaluation   he was switched over the clinda and gentamicin for his aspiration pneumonia and again his mental status improved   on 8 10 97   the patient became unresponsive and apneic   brachial consult was obtained and the patient was intubated and transferred to the intensive care unit   he was found to be profoundly hypoxic with sats down to 60  on 100  facemask   he was hypotensive into the 80s   an electrocardiogram showed evolving inferior q wave with increased st segment and left anterior st depressions   rv leads were negative for st elevation   a chest x ray showed marked congestive heart failure with increased heart size   a portable echo showed no pericardial effusion and his left ventricle was severely diffusely hypokinetic with septal dyskinesis   anterior and inferior akinesis   apical akinesis to the posterior lateral wall moved slightly   he had about 20  mild mitral regurgitation   the right ventricle was markedly dilated with a kinetic free wall and very decreased function in a marked incomplete closure of the tricuspid valve with wide open tricuspid regurgitation   he was transferred to the intensive care unit for his acute myocardial infarction with very likely multi vessel disease with concominent left anterior descending severe stenosis or likely left anterior descending with collateral circulation from that occluded right coronary artery   the patient was also evaluated by neurosurgery   given the difficult situation   the patient was not a candidate for streptokinase or tpa given his chronic subdurals with a recent new bleed   he was evaluated by neurosurgery   who felt that if heparin could be avoided   that would be best   he was treated conservatively with intubation   control of heart rate and on dobutamine for pressure support   he was diuresed with lasix and diuril and was oxygenating fairly well while intubated   he surprisingly made it through the next 24 hours   he was dynamically stable on his dobutamine with improved oxygenation   the patient continued fairly stable while intubated   two days after the myocardial infarction he continued with stable blood pressure on a very small amount of dobutamine   he had diuresed very well with good oxygenation   his neurostatus was indeterminate given his sedation on the ventilatory   discussions with the family were ongoing regarding do not resuscitate and long term plan given his comorbidities   they were waiting appropriately for some information from the repeat echo after his myocardial infarction   an echo showed that there was not much improvement in cardiac function   both right or left ventriculus   they did at that time decide to make him do not resuscitate   but were interested in continuing supportive care to see how much he would bounce back   the repeat echo showed no improvement in left ventricle or right ventricle function with marked akinesis of many walls   the lack of meaningful recovery was much less likely   discussions were had with the family regarding withdrawal of ventilator support   which they very appropriately decided on given the low possibility of any meaningful recovery   he was extubated successfully and was breathing comfortably on his own   the patient was transferred back to the medical floor in stable   but very guarded condition   no further blood draws were done   the patient was made comfortable on a low dose of intravenous morphine with sectioning to prevent further aspiration   comfort measures continued until the day 8 19 97   where mr  koteleebdils was found

after aggressive diuresis on the medical service   he was deemed stable for surgery   after many discussions between dr  leickgrend   the patient   and his family   concerning the severely high risk   given the patient  s conditions   it was decided to proceed with the operation   on 4 27 95   he was taken to the operating room where he underwent a sigmoid colectomy under general endotracheal anesthesia   his fluids were very strongly restricted   and he only received 500 cc  of crystalloid in the operating room with 400 cc  of blood loss and 500 cc  of ascites evacuated   he was taken to

 radiation   and hormonal treatment   she had actually completed her five years of tomaxifin   but was continuing to be plagued by menopausal symptoms and finally in the summery of 2004 understanding the obvious potential risks   she began an estrogen patch   not long afterwards she began to develop some bone pains which progressed over the late summer and fall requiring escalation of opiates and restaging confirmed the presence of metastases throughout her spine and in the base of her skull   ribs   arms   etc     but no visceral involvement   she ultimately was admitted to the hospital because of delirium and difficulty controlling the pain   she had no fevers   chills   headaches   or neck stiffness   there had been no focal neurologic changes   up until this admission she had been relatively independent and was very dismayed to discover the extensive relapse of her disease   on admission to the hospital her temperature was 99   heart rate 99   blood pressure 151 87   o2 saturation on room air was 92    she did look mildly dyspneic   her lungs were clear   she had good range of motion throughout except for severe local tenderness and swelling on the mid third of her right clavicle which impaired right shoulder movement   she was oriented to place and name and this waxed and waned over the next couple of days   the rest of her neurologic exam was essentially intact   laboratory data  sodium of 137   bun of 25   creatinine of 0 9   glucose of 77   calcium slightly high at 10 9 with an albumin of 3 7   bilirubin normal   her alt 11   her ast slightly up at

20 50 white cells   a ca 153 was significantly elevated at 66 5   normal 0 30     the patient was brought to the floor   hydrated gently   given another dose of zomaten to help with her calcium and over the next few days remained relatively lethargic while we held some of her long acting opiates   she gradually began to improve and was able to tell if the worst pain was in the right clavicle   this was assessed promptly by an x ray that confirmed pathologic fracture of that site   she also went on to have cervical   thoracic   and lumbosacral mris to confirm the wide spread bony metastases in the vertebral bodies and old degenerative changes perhaps with some indentation of the thecal sac but with no radiologic evidence for cord compression   she had had some urinary hesitancy and difficulty moving her legs in the first few days that had lead to the concern to           quinine syndrome but as soon as the opiates were tapered down she was able to void spontaneously and soon began to ambulate with the help of physical therapy   a single fraction to the collar bone seemed to help with pain   her bowels required fairly heavy duty osmotic laxatives to keep them open   the sudden plunge in such a dependent state left her quite depressed and ultimately a small dose of dexedrine was started partly to overcome the sedation of the opiates and perhaps improve her mood since more traditional antidepressants would take four to six weeks   plan  escalate the doses of the dexedrine perhaps up to a maximum of 10 mg at 8 o clock in the morning and another 10 mg around noon and see if she can get reasonable sleep at night on this schedule   adding on remeron at night time for sleep as an antidepressant would be a possibility or to go right to a conventional ssri overlap until it seems to show more affect   she lives with her elderly husband and he was appropriately overwhelmed by the prospect of caring for her single handedly   hence the transfer to a skilled nursing facility for a week or two of rehab   the patient and husband clearly expressed during this visit that she would not want cardiopulmonary resuscitation or intubation and ventilator support in the event of cardiopulmonary arrest   she was begun on letrazole as an              inhibitor for her breast cancer and discussions were begun to consider a possible course or two of xeloda perhaps at a dose reduced scheduled if she continues to make progress in rehab and can return to dr  first  s office to have further discussions of this later approach   discharge medications  zofran 8 mg p o  q 8

 the patient  s shortness of breath and wheezing continued but without change   her cardiac examination remained the same and there continued to be no evidence of tamponade   cardiology felt that follow up echo was indicated on 06 18 as she had another echocardiogram which showed no change or evidence of tamponade   they therefore felt that she could be continued to be followed by examination   she had some mental status changes with confusion and hallucinations on 06 18 originating from narcotics versus decreased po2   the ifex was held as it was felt that it could have precipitated the

with a longstanding history of renal disease with multiple complications and problems related to vascular access and hypercoagulable state   these culminated in an attempted cadaveric kidney transplant undertaken on 12 16 97   which was complicated by thrombosis and necrosis of the cadaveric renal vein within 24 hours   this required a transplant nephrectomy   hospital course and treatment  the patient  s course was subsequently characterized by recurrent pneumonias   possibly due to aspiration   and by hemodynamic instability   he was transferred to the medical intensive care unit from the transplant service for ventilatory management in the setting of hypotension   on transfer   the patient was not sedated   but was unresponsive and extremely dyssynchronous with the ventilator   the patient was found to have substantial auto peep with an elevated dead space   a pulmonary arteriogram on 01 03 98 demonstrated multiple pulmonary emboli   likely less than one week old   possibly introduced at the time of the renal vein thrombosis of 12 19 97   an inferior vena cava filter was placed   lower extremity noninvasive studies were negative   the patient required high pressures to ventilate adequately   possibly related to an abdominal compartment syndrome   the patient had undergone two abdominal procedures following explantation   the physiology at the time of transfer to the medical intensive care unit was consistent with a septic process   ct scan demonstrated retroperitoneal collection containing both free air and extravasated contrast material   for the concern of a perforated viscus   the patient was taken to exploratory laparotomy on 01 06 98   during which the bowel was run without evidence of perforation   the patient remained unstable   he was taken to fluoroscopy   where oral contrast was demonstrated to be extravasating through a posterior duodenum   for this reason   he was taken again to the operating room on 01 08 98   at which time a gastrojejunostomy was performed with stapling across the gastroduodenal junction   introduction of five jackson pratt drains into the retroperitoneal mass   cholecystotomy tube   gastrostomy tube   and jejunostomy tube   the patient had an extensive estimated blood loss requiring multiple blood products and fluid resuscitation therapy   accompanying this during this period were elevations in liver function studies and amylase and lipase consistent with pancreatic inflammation   the patient was aggressively treated with fluid resuscitation and pressors for his septic physiology   there was no evidence of cardiac tamponade or specific underlying coronary dysfunction   he was treated with appropriate antibiotics for his serratia pneumonia   as well as for his abdominal process   the patient was felt to have an underlying hypercoagulable state   thought to be the source for the repeated clots   because of the bleeding problems   however   it was felt that full heparinization would not be prudent   and the patient was treated with pneumo boots and subcutaneous heparin   attention was paid to a variety of metabolic and electrolyte abnormalities   which were corrected appropriately   nonetheless   mr  less continued to remain critically ill with only very transient mild improvement with drainage of additional retroperitoneal fluid   he remained pressor dependent   as well as dependent upon mechanical ventilatory assistance   his course was complicated by atrial fibrillation requiring cardioversion   he had an ongoing requirement for high volume resuscitation and was persistently acidotic despite cv vvh in the face of bicarbonate replenishment   the patient also appeared to have stool from his jackson pratt site and right oblique incision   bloody drainage from his increasingly distended abdomen was noted   extensive discussions were carried out with mrs  less condition was irretrievable   it was felt that the patient had continued massive retroperitoneal contamination and probable multiple enteric fistulae from an ischemic bowel   dr  cantsleddjesc felt that no surgical approach to this problem or further intervention or radiologic

reviewed with his wife   sligh   she noted that he was actively working full time and was a sales representative at the leigh and lives at home with her and his daughter   age 18   it was felt that   because of the evidence of congestive heart failure and the critical left main lesion   he should be admitted for further evaluation   indeed   he was treated with diuretics and nitrates along with cessation of his aspirin   and he was put on iv heparin   he stabilized over the weekend   he was noted to have some ventricular ectopy on holter monitor   he developed epigastric pain on 07 31 which previously had been ignored but in retrospect was probably his anginal equivalent   he also had multifocal ventricular ectopy at that time   he had some further anterolateral st segment changes   therefore   he did have unstable angina with his critical coronary anatomy   the patient was seen in consultation by the electrophysiology service   dr  slusslashgodle   who said that he had no indication for patch placement at the time of surgery   on 08 02 93   an intra aortic balloon pump was placed   then   dr  thorebreutz took him to the operating room   where he had quadruple coronary

weaned and extubated   he had good hemodynamics   he had occasional atrial and ventricular premature beats   his intra aortic balloon pump was weaned the following day and he was transferred out of the surgical intensive care unit   he was seen in consultation by the nutrition service   who followed him for dietary management of his diabetes mellitus   on 08 05 it was noted that his platelet count had fallen from 171 000 to 54 000   this was thought to be associated with intravenous heparin and indeed   when heparin was discontinued   since it had been restarted after surgery   his platelet count rebounded to normal   therefore   he does have a thrombocytopenic reaction to heparin   he remained in normal sinus rhythm   he did have runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia   which were clinically stable   he had a right bundle branch block   he is at increased risk for future events because of his low left ventricular ejection fraction   but he is clinically stable on ace

principal diagnosis  wolfe parkinson white syndrome   associated diagnosis  atrial fibrillation   coronary artery disease   hypertension   dementia   and diabetes   history of present illness  the patient is a 72 year old white male who was transferred from cay memorial hospital of for cardiac catheterization and electrophysiology studies   his cardiac risk factors include   hypercholesterolemia   hypertension and insulin dependent diabetes mellitus   he has a history of chest pain and in january 1993 underwent a cardiac catheterization at ph university of medical center which revealed an occluded right coronary artery with distal filling via left to right collaterals   a large left anterior descending with a 40 50  proximal stenosis and a co dominant left circumflex with mild disease   he subsequently had an echocardiogram in december 1994 which showed normal left ventricular size and systolic function   he subsequently had an adenosine sestamibi in february 1997 which was negative for ischemia or infarction   in december 1994 he had a paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia presenting with palpitations   he was diagnosed with wolfe parkinson white syndrome   he underwent an electrophysiology study which identified an accessory pathway with multiple attempts at ablation by dr  slusslashgodle which were unsuccessful   he was treated with sotalol for the supraventricular tachycardia   on 9 2 98 he was admitted to cay memorial hospital of with palpitations and was found to have an irregular wide complex tachycardia thought to be due to atrial fibrillation and conduction down his accessory pathway   he had mild congestive heart failure and was treated with an increased dose of lasix   an echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of approximately 50  and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation   he was discharged home but returned on 9 13 98 with worsening palpitations on and off   he was again found to be in a wide complex tachycardia and was treated with magnesium   he denied any associated chest pain or dyspnea and he ruled out for a myocardial infarction   he continued to have intermittent runs of the wide complex tachycardia and was therefore transferred to ph university of medical center for further evaluation and management   prior to transfer he did have one episode of chest pain during the night without electrocardiogram changes   past medical history  hypertension   hypercholesterolemia   diabetes mellitus   depression   prostate cancer status post surgery   medications on admission  sotalol 160 mg

codeine and iodine   there was also a question of an allergy to prednisone which he said causes eye swelling   however   the details of this are quite uncertain and it is not clear if this was a true allergy   physical exam  he was comfortable with a blood pressure of 156 78   pulse 56 and respirations of 16   his lungs were clear throughout   his apical impulse was nondisplaced with a regular rate and rhythm   normal s1 and s2 but not s3 or s4   there was a grade 1 6 holosystolic murmur at the lower left sternal border radiating to the apex   carotid pulses were 2  bilaterally and there was no jugular venous distention   his abdomen was benign   femoral pulses were 2  bilaterally without bruits and he had pedal edema bilaterally   laboratory data  bun 18   creatinine 1 8   magnesium 1 5   cholesterol 154 with an hdl 41   ldl 100   his creatinine phosphokinase was 42   his hematocrit was 49 3   his electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia with a delta wave and an intraventricular conduction delay consistent with wolf parkinson white syndrome   there were also nonspecific st t wave abnormalities   hospital course and treatment  the patient clearly was suffering from atrial arrhythmias conducting down his bypass tract which were difficult to manage and causing symptomatic palpitations   given his known coronary artery disease and his recent heart failure and chest pain a cardiac catheterization was indicated prior to proceeding to an electrophysiology study   his initial cardiac catheterization had to be postponed given the possibility of an allergy to prednisone   he was seen by nnoatal hospital center who felt that he could be safely treated with solumedrol rather than prednisone together with benadryl and the use of low ionic contrast medium   accordingly the patient underwent uneventful cardiac catheterization on 9 17 98 which revealed a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 25 and a left ventricular end diastolic pressure of 20   his right coronary artery was occluded and filled distally via left to right collaterals   he had a 50  proximal left anterior descending stenosis and only minor disease to the left circumflex   his left ventriculogram showed preserved systolic function and mild mitral regurgitation   the patient then underwent an electrophysiology study on 9 20 98   there was no inducible supraventricular tachycardia but he did have evidence of a left lateral bypass tract   mapping of the mitral anulus confirmed the location of the bypass tract   radiofrequency ablation was applied there and resulted in the elimination of the preoperatively excitation   there were no complications   following the procedure there was no further evidence of wide complex tachycardia   he still did have occasional short runs of atrial tachycardia but there were no associated palpitations   in following up his ablation he underwent a holter monitor which showed normal sinus rhythm at rates of 40 to 80   there were 15 atrial runs the longest of which was 13 beats at a rate of 100   he also underwent a post procedural echocardiogram which showed an ejection fraction of 61  with mild mitral regurgitation and left atrial enlargement at 45mm   following the procedure his qt interval was noted to be prolonged to approximately  55 seconds   his sotalol was therefore decreased to 120 mg bid and his qt and qtc intervals decreased to  45  48 seconds   after the procedure he was started on heparin and loaded on coumadin for a period of the next 3 4 weeks following radiofrequency ablation   his inr was 2 3 prior to discharge and he was scheduled to follow up with the anticoagulation clinic to follow his coumadin dose   finally   his dementia appeared to worsen following receiving medications for agitation during his ep study   accordingly he was seen by neurology who felt that there was no evidence of a secondary process   he did have a head ct which showed no evidence of a bleed or stroke   finally   his blood pressure had trended up during his hospitalization particularly with the decreased dose of sotalol   given his occasional sinus bradycardia his atenolol was not advanced but instead his zestril dose was increased from 10 20 mg bid and his blood pressure responded appropriately   condition on discharge  he was discharged in stable condition on 9 23 98   he will have a

idiosyncratic reaction to cyclosporine was considered as cause for cerebritis   and cyclosporine was discontinued   however   much more likely explanation is progressive infection of acanthamoeba with

present illness  the patient is a 55 year old man who is status post resection of a klatskin tumor   who returns with persistent jaundice and right upper quadrant pain   the present illness is marked by presentation with jaundice and pain in august of 1994   and a computerized tomography scan that showed bile duct dilatation   in september 1994   he had an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography that shoed obstruction at the confluence of the left and right hepatic ducts   in october 1994   the klatskin tumor was resected and it was shown to be moderately differentiated cholangiocarcinoma   the surgical margins were positive and he was treated postoperatively with radiation therapy and chemotherapy   he was admitted in january 1994   for biliary drainage catheter placement and balloon dilatation of what was thought to be an anastomotic stricture   biopsies and fine needle aspirates were suspicious for recurrent cholangiocarcinoma   since that time he had been persistently jaundiced and fatigued   until three weeks prior to admission when the patient had a biliary tube check   which showed things to be patent despite his rising bilirubin   he presented now for evaluation of failed biliary drainage   physical examination  on physical examination   he had a normal temperature and blood pressure   his lungs were clear   his head and neck showed marked scleral icterus and a cardiac examination showed a systolic ejection murmur   the abdomen was soft and had well healed right upper quadrant scar   the extremities were unremarkable   rectal examination was negative and his neurological examination was intact   laboratory data  his hematocrit was 25 8    with a normal white blood cell count   his bilirubin was total 11 1   with a direct bilirubin of 10 2 and his alkaline phosphatase was 2 188   hospital course  he was admitted and started on intravenous antibiotics and studied with an abdominal computerized tomography scan   the computerized tomography scan showed dilated left and right hepatic ducts and was consistent with some form of blockage of the drainage arrangement   what then ensued was multiple attempts to insure adequate biliary decompression by use of percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram and placement of biliary catheters and stents   the procedures took place on several days throughout the hospital stay with the sentinel pro cedure taking place on 3 28 95   and this was placement of the 10 mm diameter metal wallstents   subsequent to that   he was found to have a subhepatic fluid collection   which was suspicious for a bile leak and therefore a drain was placed percutaneously into this collection   on 3 31 95 and 04 04 95   very mild revisions were made of these and the feeling was that solution had been reached with good drainage   his bilirubin by the time of discharge had fallen from a peak of 28 down to a discharge value of 8   he was feeling much better   taking good diet and denying pain or fever   during the course of the hospitalization   he was found to have diarrhea and stool was sent and found to be positive for clostridium difficile toxin and this

aneurysm at the eifro medical center which was evaluated with a chest x ray and abdominal ct scan   at that time the patient denied any symptoms of aneurysmal pain and did not suffer significant injury from her motor vehicle accident   she was subsequently referred to dr  riode zetllille for evaluation and workup of her aneurysm   the patient underwent a thoracic abdominal arteriogram on 12 31 93 via a right femoral approach and she was noted to have a large descending aorta with tortuosity but no aneurysmal dilatation of the infrarenal abdominal aorta   the patient was discharged after

aneurysm which she tolerated well   there were no intraoperative complications   she was taken to the surgical intensive care unit postoperatively   the patient  s procedure was also remarkable for the fact that she underwent spinal cooling during this procedure   the patient remained intubated postoperatively   she had a stable first postoperative day without evidence of hemodynamic or cardiopulmonary deterioration   on postoperative day 1 she had a slight hematocrit drop to 27 2 which was expected with hydration in addition to intraoperative volume loss but otherwise had an unremarkable course   epidural anesthesia was used throughout her course for pain management and she was transferred to the surgical floor on postoperative day two   the patient developed an episode of atrial fibrillation with physical examination consistent with only mild cardiopulmonary congestion as manifested by bilateral scattered rales in the lung fields   serum electrolytes at the time revealed normal potassium levels and the patient was treated with p r n  verapamil and digoxin therapy for a heart rate varying between 80 and 110   the patient  s oxygen saturations continued to maintain at levels greater than 95 percent and this was felt to be well controlled and she was placed on digoxin chronically and also diuresed for therapy   she was transferred to the surgical floor where on postoperative day three she began to complain of hypersensitivity in the left lower extremity and inability to move her toes   this was a new finding considering postoperatively she had full motor and sensory function of all four extremities   neurologic assessment at the time did in fact reveal profound paresis of the left lower extremity only with absent reflexes but hyperesthesia to light touch throughout the lower extremities   laboratory data obtained revealed no significant changes from her initial postoperative levels   neurological consultation was obtained   it was felt that the patient had been subjected significant cord ischemia and possibly this neurologic event also related to spinal or epidural catheter placement   the epidural catheter had been removed prior to their evaluation and no return of significant function was noted over the ensuing two days aside from flexion and extension of the toes but still the patient maintained profound proximal lower extremity weakness   mri obtained did not reveal evidence of a structural cause for cord or root dysfunction and further recommendation of abdominal ct scanning in addition to emgs and sseps to further evaluate and confirm the site of the lesion be performed   the patient continued to do well otherwise being slowly progressed in her diet and mobilized from bed to chair without difficulty   she was placed on a bowel regimen to alleviate signs and symptoms of constipation while the workup to determine the exact etiology of her left lower extremity paresis could be identified   continued supportive care was performed for the patient as again she manifested no other significant signs of hemodynamic or neurologic deterioration   her ultimate diagnosis was subsequently felt to be a segmental infarction of the anterior and lateral part of her t10 level spinal cord and there was no evidence of that recovery of her left lower extremity would be obtained   social service consultation for rehabilitation placement was performed   the patient understands the ramifications of her disability and continued neurologic assessment is to be made   the patient continued to make slight gains in motor movement of the left lower extremity as manifested by digital function and some knee jerk return and by postoperative day eight she was manifesting some dorsiflexion in addition to urodynamics being performed revealed good detrusion contraction   normal sensation and a coordinated sphincter which suggested no disability to the sympathetic control of her bowel and bladder   the patient complained of some urinary incontinence and urgency on the 10th postoperative day   she was placed on bactrim therapy for e  coli positive urine culture and emg performed revealed a lesion

on magnetic resonance imaging study   hospital course  following the standard preoperative evaluation   he was taken to the operating room and underwent a laminectomy t11   t12   and l1 and intradural microsurgical exploration   at the time of surgery we found an invasive conus tumor emanating from the ventral portio of the conus and completely engulfing and encircling all of the ventral nerve roots   the procedure had been done with intraoperative monitoring   and every time we made an attempt to dissect tumor away from the nerve roots we achieved considerable stimulation of the lower extremity muscles   we felt that the way the tumor was invading and wrapped around all of the nerves and sharing a common blood supply with them   that it would not be possible to achieve any form of significant surgical decompression or removal of tumor without leading to a substantial neurological deficit   therefore   the operation was terminated by placing a large dural graft to provide intradural room with the idea that postoperatively the lesion would be treated with radiation therapy   the patient tolerated the procedure well   the postoperative course was without complication

he was also started on intravenous ticarcillin for possible gram negative pneumonia   he was diuresed with intravenous lasix to which he responded with at lease a 2l urine output on the first day and 1 5l the second day   after one day in the medical intensive care unit the patient was stable enough to go to the floor where he continued the rest of his treatment   this consisted of continued nebulizer treatments as well as intravenous antibiotics and intravenous solu medrol   as the patient  s diuresis continued his respiratory status improved   a chest x ray showed clearing of the opacities in the chest x ray that were consistent with pulmonary edema because he continued to have some abnormality in the right lower lobe   the patient was continued on antibiotics for possible pneumonia   the antibiotic chosen was levaquin 500 mg 1 tab per day   this was started on 4 2 99 and should be continued for ten days   the ticarcillin was stopped after two days when it was felt that he did not have a serious pneumonia   the patient  s respiratory status continued to improve but towards the last 2 3 days of his hospitalization the amount of improvement was minimal   it was felt that his respiratory status has been maximally treated by then   the patient  s major improvement came after the first two days with brisk diuresis with lasix   while in the oaksgekesser  memorial hospital the patient on 4 4 99 complained of mild epigastric discomfort because he was put in cimetidine while in the intensive care unit for prophylaxis against peptic ulcer disease   the patient was upgraded to prilosec 20 mg per day for possible treatment of gastritis or gastroesophageal reflux disease   the patient did have any nausea   vomiting or evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding   the

living   discussion with the family regarding the possibility of sending him to a nursing home was entertained however the family strongly refused to allow him to go a nursing home   they wanted the patient to return to his home after a stay at a rehab facility   condition on discharge  the patient  s respiratory status was stable   i think his breathing was as good as to be expected with the

1994 and was admitted to tecal galecounxopt community hospital   the coronary angiogram performed during his hospitalization had revealed 95  of left anterior descending artery disease and diffuse left circumflex disease   an echocardiogram had revealed an ejection fraction of 41  with apicalakinesis   he had undergone electrophysiology study and his incessant ventricular tachycardia was interrupted by transcatheter radio frequency ablation   after the ablation procedure   programmed stimulation had initiated another ventricular tachycardia with distinct surface qrs configuration but since there was no spontaneous ventricular tachycardia   the other forms were not pursued vigorously   the patient was discharged while on procainamide and coumadin   on march 8   he developed palpitations with shortness of breath and chest pain   the patient was admitted to an outside hospital in xingwa moineswest where a wide complex tachycardia with a rate of 160 beats per minute was demonstrated   the tachycardia had not responded to intravenous lidocaine or procainamide but has responded to intravenous verapamil   the patient was transferred to tecal galecounxopt community

 the chest x ray showed mild cardiomegaly   hospital course  the patient was admitted to the step down unit   the patient continued to experience multiple episodes of sustained and nonsustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia   intravenous procainamide was started   which reduced the frequency and the duration of the ventricular tachycardia   on march 11   the patient underwent an electrophysiology study   during the study   ventricular tachycardia with a cycle length of 510 milliseconds was reproducibly induced by extra stimuli delivered from the right ventricular apex   pace mapping studies had demonstrated that the origin of the tachycardia to be in the inferior   lateral and apical left ventricle   after mapping of the tachycardia   radio frequency ablation was carried out with four current applications   terminating the ventricular tachycardia in three of the four times   after radio frequency ablation   no sustained ventricular tachycardias occurred   however   there were periods of supraventricular tachycardias with a rate of 160 180 beats per minute and the patient was placed on sotalol   since the patient was known to have multiple different ventricular

automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator testing were performed   under brief propafol anesthesia   rapid ventricular tachycardia was induced by ramp pacing   this was properly detected and converted to normal sinus rhythm with a single 34 joule countershock   three zones were programmed in the cardiac defibrillator   for tachycardias with heart rate between 110 and 140 beats per minute

gastrointestinal bleed   during this time in january of 1992 dr  blood had noted two distal esophageal ulcers   he had treated both of these with epinephrine injection   follow up endoscopy on mar 15   1992 had shown two deformities in the distal esophagus corresponding to the presence of esophageal ulcers treated earlier in january   there was also a 4 cm  hiatus hernia from 36 cm  to 40 cm   the stomach and duodenum were otherwise normal   from dr  blood  s standpoint on mar 15   1992 there was no contraindication to coumadinization   we discussed coumadinization with dr  blood and noting dr  blood  s earlier findings we   in conjunction with dr  blood decided to coumadinize the patient and coumadinization was begun on 5 30 92   it was noted at that time that a stable dose for the patient earlier when he had been coumadinized before was 5 mg  po q day   that was concurrent with albuterol 150 mg  po q day   given the patient  s history of ulcer and hiatus hernia and the fact that we did wish to anticoagulate the patient we actually performed upper endoscopy on the patient on 5 31 92   the findings were as follows   the principal operating surgeon was dr  ca scgach with the assistance of dr  jesclinke   the principal findings were a 5 0 cm  hiatal hernia and apparent ingree and ot of weamanshy medical center  s esophagus distally   in the stomach there were mild erosions of the gastroesophageal junction without other abnormalities   there were no abnormalities into the second portion of the duodenum   the overall impression was that there was an apparent healed esophageal ulcer   a hiatus hernia   an esophageal mucosal changes distally were consistent with a barrett  s esophagus   no biopsy was taken   the biopsy was deferred because the patient had received a dose of coumadin the night before and had a prothrombin time of approximately 15 before the procedure   on 6 1 92 the patient went to the echocardiography suite   findings were   there was no evidence of intracardiac thrombus   although this was a transcardiac echocardiogram which is not the best technique for visualizing intraatrial thrombus   there was a thickened mitral leaflet with mild mitral regurgitation   there was focal calcification in the mitral annulus   the aortic leaflets were thickened with no aortic stenosis   there was trace aortic insufficiency   the aorta at the sinuses was ectactic at 42 millimeters   the left ventricular size and function were within normal limits with a left ventricular ejection fractio n of 57 percent   there was trace tricuspid insufficiency   there was evidence of an old pacer wire in the right atrium   there was trace pulmonary insufficiency with right ventricular systolic blood pressure of 35 millimeters   there was paradoxical septal motion consistent with bundle branch block   the patient   it should be noted at this time   was doing very well and he was taking regular diet   voiding spontaneously   he had been therapeutically heparinized since going to the operating room and by 6 2 92 his prothrombin time was beginning to elevate   on 6 2 92 he presented a new complaint with left wrist swelling and pain   he confessed to a history of gout in the past and consequently rheumatology consult was obtained   the rheumatologist entertained gout as an attractive diagnosis given his history and they aspirated the joint   joint aspirate was remarkable for calcium phosphate crystals   that is the patient actually had a case of pseudo gout   joint aspirate that was sent for culture has been negative to date and today is 6 4 92   the rheumatologist recommended checking a wrist xray to rule out calcification   a wrist xray was obtained of the left wrist and it did show chondrocalcinosis thus confirming the diagnosis of pseudo gout   the patient  s pseudogout was treated with colchicine 0 6 mg  po q  3 hours and he received nine such doses over a time span of about 42 hours with some relief of his symptoms   he is being discharged on colchicine 0 6 mg  po t i d  as an acute measure for his pseudo gout and that prescription will last until he sees dr  blood in follow up this coming tuesday   today   on 6 4 92   the patient has no new complaint   yesterday   on 6 3 92   his prothrombin time was just a bit over 16   between 16 and 17 and consequently his heparin was discontinued   today his prothrombin time is 16 7 and it looks like 5 mg  of coumadin per day is going to be a stable dose for him   consequently   he is ready for discharge today   the only other thing of note is that secondary to his anticoagulation with coumadin his ecotrin has been discontinued   medications on discharge  isordil 10 mg  po t i d  ditropan 5 mg  po q i d  cimetidine 400 mg  po b i d  omeprazole 20 mg  po b i d

were negative   the patient was treated with fluconazole in case there was any monilia   although biopsy did not confirm the presence of monilia   gradually during the hospitalization   the sternal pain improved   as did the pain in the left hip and the patient became able to ambulate somewhat   he was making progress and accordingly   a second course of chemotherapy was given at lower dose   he received vp 16 100 mg daily x three   9 12   9 13 and 9 14 93   and cisplatin 40 mg daily x three on that same date with zofran 10 mg  the only problem was some recurrent nausea   the radiation therapy was finally finished on the day of discharge   9 19 93   at which point the patient was able to take fluids and food but was still occasionally vomiting   his white blood count was in the

therefore completely cultured again and begun on antibiotic coverage which would take care of the pseudomonas he was known to have   the steroids were tapered   he was also begun on anti candida regimen for his urinary tract infection with yeast being seen   because of the story of hemoptysis   he also underwent an exotic bleeding work up for such things as wegner  s and goodpasture  s   these results were all negative   he continued to require very high fio2   he was found to have a dvt by ultrasound   he underwent a trial of tpa followed by heparin   this produced substantially

her hospitalization her electrocardiograms remained unchanged and she ruled out for myocardial infarction by enzymes   her oxygen saturations remained 88 93 percent on four liters of nasal prong oxygen   upon review of her computerized tomography scan there was demonstration of progressive collapse of her left lower lobe with a mass like effect adjacent to the atelectasis   there were two large mediastinal nodes and needle biopsy of the left lobe lesion was non diagnostic   she was referred for tissue diagnosis and on 1 13 94 was brought to the operating room   she underwent flexible bronchoscopy with mediastinoscopy   these were negative for tumor and a mini left thoracotomy was performed with pleural biopsy   intraoperatively there was a large emphysematous portion of the left lung which prohibited her left lower lobe to fully expand   it was decided to perform reduction pneumoplasty   this proceeded uneventfully   she was extubated and stable with a good airway and good oxygen saturation   however   upon transferring her from the operating room bed to the stretcher she had an arrest   this appeared to be respiratory in origin   she was placed back on the operating room table and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was begun   pressors were given and she quickly responded with a return in blood pressure and heart rate   her blood pressure remained unstable requiring large amounts of pressors   x rays showed no pneumothorax and there was no bleeding from her chest tubes   she was therefore transferred up to the respiratory intensive care unit   early in her postoperative course her pulmonary artery pressures were quite high   70 30   her wedge pressure was 20 and there were no electrocardiogram changes   she ruled out for myocardial infarction   she developed a picture consistent with right heart failure with pulmonary hypertension and require nitric oxide administration   this improved her right heart function with lower pa pressures   she developed a right pleural effusion which required chest tube placement to remove 1200 ccs of straw colored fluid   she remained fully ventilated with marginal hemodynamic status on levophed   dobutamine and nitric oxide   ultimately she was able to be weaned off of her levophed as well as her nitric oxide   however   because of persistent episodes of right heart failure   dobutamine was started   this improved her cardiac function   she failed to wean from the ventilator and on 2 14 94 was brought to the operating room for a tracheostomy   she had a complicated course from an infectious disease standpoint with multiple positive cultures including sputum positive for pseudomonas cepacia   blood cultures which were positive for streptococcus milleri   the right pleural fluid was also positive for streptococcus milleri   she had citrobacter from her sinuses with evidence of sinusitis   she was treated with multiple courses of broad spectrum antibiotics   given her

present illness  this is a 56 year old man with a history of ischemic disease transferred to the fih for further care for cardiogenic shock   mr  given had an anterior myocardial infarction in 1981   he had inferior myocardial infarction in february 1992   his course was complicated at that time by hypertension and an echocardiogram showed an lv ejection fraction of 0 10 to 0 15   in august   1993 he had an out of hospital cardiac arrest   he rule in for another myocardial infarction at that time   he was transferred to the fih where he underwent a work up of both his arrhythmia and his heart failure   an automatic implantable defibrillator was placed   he was thought to be a good candidate for a transplant at that time as coronary arteriography showed diffuse disease in the lad and right coronary arteries as well as a proximal circumflex stenosis   because of the diffuse nature of the disease and the left ventricular dysfunction   mr  given was thought not to be a revascularization candidate and was listed for a transplant   mr  given waited as an outpatient for the availability of a donor heart   he was admitted to the hospital in late april with multiple episodes of bloody diarrhea   colonoscopy demonstrated severe crohn  s disease with sparing of the rectum   a perirectal fistula was seen   treatment with iv corticosteroids led to improvement and mr  given was discharged from the hospital ten days ago   on the evening of april 22nd   mr  given developed progressively worsening dyspnea   he presented to the iming medical center emergency room on the morning of april 22nd with hypertension and dyspnea   he was given intravenous fluid to support his blood pressure and developed pulmonary edema and was intubated   hypertension continued and an intra aortic balloon pump was placed   he is now being transferred to the fih for further treatment   physical examination  physical examination on transfer was remarkable for a blood pressure of 80 56 and a heart rate of 124   his cvp was 16   he was on the balloon pump at the time   his chest was clear anteriorly   his cardiac exam was remarkable for a summation gallop   no murmur was auscultated but the high heart rate did diminish the possibility of this   his abdomen was soft and he had no extremity edema   his feet were cool but there were pedal pulses bilaterally   laboratory data  admission laboratory studies included a hematocrit of 34 3 and a white count of 25 700   the sodium was 126   the bun 80 and a creatinine of 4 6   electrocardiogram revealed a sinus tachycardia with an intraventricular conduction defect   there were inferior q waves consistent with an old infarct   the chest x ray revealed mild pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly   hospital course  mr  given was admitted to the hospital and it was hoped that his end organ dysfunction would improve with a period of ballooning and improved perfusion such as to allow transplantation to eventually take place   he was maintained on levophed as a vasopressor as well as dopamine and dobutamine   it was noted that his intra aortic balloon pump was only a 30 ml pump   and on the day after admission   mr  given was taken to the catheterization laboratory where this was exchanged for a 40 ml pump   after replacement of the intra aortic balloon pump   mr  given remained critically ill   although there was some improvement in his augmented diastolic pressure   he did develop atrial fibrillation   however   which led to hemodynamic decompensation with a wedge pressure of 32 and a cardiac index of 1 6   it was hoped that with continued inotropic support this would improve   he also remained intubated   mr  given was seen by dr  farstshuff of the gi service for advice regarding his crohn  s disease   all of these issues   including his acute renal failure   were thought to be contraindications to transplantation   as mr  given did not have any bowel sounds   he did have to remain on nasogastric suction   he was seen in consultation by dr  needs of the renal unit   dr  needs felt that the patient had had ischemic acute tubular necrosis and that we could continue to administer diuretics in a an effort to take off volume   but that we did have to allow time to pass in order to see improvement   procainamide was begun in an effort to convert mr  given to sinus rhythm from atrial fibrillation   initially he was in and out of sinus rhythm   but paroxysmal atrial fibrillation did occur frequently   as mr  given  s renal function did not improve   he was begun on continuous venovenous hemodialysis   this resulted in a reasonable clearance of creatinine   he was able to get some fluid off as well   with getting some volume off   the patient  s ventilation improved   as did many of his other metabolic parameters   his cardiac index had also improved with this to 2 7   although he was on dobutamine as well   on 6 19 an effort was made to attempt to wean the intra aortic balloon pump   with a decrease in the counterpulsation ration   he developed atrial flutter with a fall in blood pressure and cardiac index   the balloon pump was restored   he was continued on this as well as on dobutamine and amrinone support   he continued on hemodialysis   but had little urine output   supportive care continued   unfortunately   the white blood count began rising   raising the possibility of sepsis   broad spectrum antibiotics to cover potential sources in the gastrointestinal tract were begun and ciprofloxacin was added   mr  given  s blood pressure appeared to stabilize   another effort was made on 6 22 to attempt to wean the balloon   but this led to an increase in his wedge pressure and a fall in his arterial pressure   and this was stopped and he was restored to full counterpulsation   he had been able to be transiently extubated after dialysis had reduced his lung water   but he had to be reintubated on 6 24   hemodialysis continued with maintenance of reasonable metabolic parameters   he did develop worsening metabolic acidosis   his hemodialysis was adjusted in an effort to resolve this   he continued on vancomycin   ciprofloxacin   zosyn   and fluconazole antibiotics   another effort was made to attempt to wean the intra aortic balloon pump on 6 26   this resulted in a fall in his cardiac index   but his blood pressure and wedge pressure were stable   he did have runs of non sustained ventricular tachycardia   on 6 29 mr  given began developing periods of hypotension   the patient stated that he did not want to be reintubated   as it became quite clear that he would not be a transplant candidate   he began having multiple runs of non sustained ventricular tachycardia   the patient and his significant friend   incloztaua   had a long discussion with his physicians and they felt that   given the futility of his situation   supportive care should be ended   indicative of this   mr  given took his oxygen mask and demanded that

metastatic melanoma to the right shoulder with partial thickness skin graft reconstruction on 9 1 00   history of present illness  this is a 69 year old man who was initially diagnosed with a right upper posterior extremity melanoma level 4   2 5 mm in depth   in 10 02 92   subsequently in 10 92 he underwent a wide excision with axillary dissection which showed residual malignant melanoma with nine negative lymph nodes   he had a recurrence in 05 99 in a similar area which was 2 1 mm in thickness   he had this resected between 8 4 and 9 5 97 and was treated with 6000 c of radiation therapy over the right upper extremity   he has done well since that time and subsequently in 05 98 had pulmonary nodules which were noted and a computer tomogram scan in 08 98 demonstrated a 4 2 cm splenic lesion   he underwent an open splenectomy in the fall 1998 which demonstrated metastatic melanoma only to the spleen   since that time he has been treated with         cells in 1999 and also with allovecting injection to the right anterior axillary nodule   most recently in he has this right anterior axillary metastatic melanoma resected at brook hospital by dr  bainpruess on with local triceps myocutaneous tissue transfer   since april through july this area has increased in size where the triceps tissue transfer has been replaced with a bulky metastatic melanoma disease   surgical consultation for resection of this for local     control was requested   the patient has     dr  peakekudz and has known visceral metastases of the liver as well the lung with mediastinal adenopathy which has been stable for the past two years   the other complicating factor in his care was that he was wheelchair bound from a viral meningeal encephalomyelitis in 1966 and has relied heavily on his upper extremity for wheelchair transfer and access and transportation   in order to workup up this metastatic melanoma recurrent after local excision only two months previously it was elected to get an magnetic resonance imaging scan of the shoulder   this magnetic resonance imaging scan confirmed that there was a large mass which measured approximately 4 6cm anterior to the deltopectoral groove and unfortunately a smaller lesion 1cm was seen separately adjacent and medial to the biceps tendon near the brachial neurovascular bundle   an magnetic resonance imaging scan which was performed three months prior to admission to brook hospital for resection demonstrated that this more medial lesion was not present at that time and therefore it was suspicious for metastatic melanoma   the patient had a fine needle aspiration of this bulky tumor mass which demonstrated malignant melanoma and subsequently he was sent for a positron emission tomography scan which was performed at s nakantlakeing university hospital and medical center on 8 24 00   the positron emission tomography scan demonstrated a known larger anterior metastatic melanoma and more medially two approximately 1cm lesions that also enhanced   these were consistent with metastatic melanoma near the brachial plexus confirmed by the magnetic resonance imaging scan   the patient now presents for surgical resection and reconstructive repair of this lesion   past medical history  viral meningeal encephalomyelitis in 1996 which left him paralyzed from waist down and wheelchair bound   he is incontinent of bowel

was his right thigh   he tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications   a vac dressing was applied postoperatively and this was maintained for four days   when this was taken down the graft was noted to be healthy with good take   it was then dressed with adaptic and bacitracin ointment and covered with a dry sterile dressing per day   the harvest site was blown dry with a blow

electrocardiogram was consistent with atrial fibrillation   hospital course  the patient was admitted to the hospital and begun on high dose hydroxyurea   with a gradual improvement in his white blood count over the next few days   he did spike a fever and began ancef and gentamicin   although cultures never revealed a source for this   he also tried amicar and continued on low dose prednisone   his headache improved   but her remained profoundly weak and intermittently febrile with dyspnea   there was hemoptysis and intermittent gastrointestinal bleeding   while he remained profoundly thrombocytopenia   transfusions of platelets did not change his platelet count   presumably because of sequestration and a massive spleen   amicar was of uncertain value   but used intermittently   a bone marrow biopsy revealed the transformation of his cmml to acute myelogenous leukemia   and given his other underlying medical problems   we chose chemotherapy with subcutaneous cystosine arabinoside and 6 thioguanine   which he tolerated without incident and this brought his white blood count down to below 1 000   and his spleen shrank noticeably   but he still could not maintain a bump in platelet count with platelet transfusions   he was intermittently congested limiting our ability to give intravenous fluid   for his hydrea   although we kept him on allopurinol   the renal function deteriorated somewhat   hampering our ability to give him his gentamicin   the family maintained an extraordinary vigil over the days of his hospitalization   providing him with some food and constant attention   while we awaited the results of his chemotherapy and treatment of his infection   he was intermittently restless and somewhat confused   and as his respiratory status deteriorated   the family agreed to a low dose morphine drip which made him much more comfortable   they agreed with a do not resuscitate status early on in the hospitalization and in the course of being maintain

of present illness: mr. breun underwent a six vessel coronary artery bypass grafting procedure in march , 1990 , following a complicated inferior posterior myocardial infarction .\\nhe had a very stormy course , dominated by post infarction angina pectoris , high grade atrial ventricular block , gastrointestinal bleeding , pneumonia , and no noliguric renal failure .\\nan intra-aortic balloon pump was required for stabilization .\\nhe also had moderately severe aortic stenosis at that time with a peak aortic valve gradient of 30 , and a calculated valve area of 1.2 cm squared .\\ndespite the magnitude of these problems , he made a remarkable recovery over the course of several months , and was able to return to work on a part-time basis , after joining a program of cardiac rehabilitation .\\npostoperatively , we measured a left ventricle ejection fraction of 40% , by gated cardiac blood pool scanning .\\nover these past 3 years , he has remained stable , on a very simple program of aspirin , and atenolol .\\nhe returned for routine office evaluation on 3/25/93 , complaining of 2 months of progressive exertional dyspnea , with occasional chest discomfort , and , more recently , orthopnea , cough , peripheral edema , and weight gain . physical examination: weight 197 lbs , up 6 lbs , blood pressure 128/88 , heart rate 70 and regular .\\nthe venous pressure was markedly elevated to 15 cm .\\nthe carotids were of low volume , and sluggish bilaterally , with transmission of a basal heart murmur .\\nthere was dullness at both bases , with rales 1/3 way upon the right , and at the base on the left .\\nthe right ventricle , and left ventricle impulses were diffuse .\\nthere was a grade i-ii murmur of aortic stenosis , with additional murmurs of tricuspid , and mitral regurgitation , and an obvious s3 .\\nthe liver was enlarged 2 finger breadths below the right costal margin , and there was 1-2+ peripheral edema .\\nhis chest x-ray demonstrated cardiomegaly , with bilateral pleural effusions , right greater than left , and pulmonary vascular re-distribution .\\nthe electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm with first degree av block , an old inferior myocardial infarction , and old anteroseptal myocardial infarction , and non-specific st-t wave abnormalities , that were unchanged compared to june , 1992 .\\nlater , an echocardiogram on 3/27/93 , demonstrated mild mitral regurgitation with calcification of the annulus , and incomplete closure of the valve , consistent with papillary muscle dysfunction .\\nthe left atrium was dilated to 52 mm .\\nthe aortic valve was thickened , with restrictive motion , and there were indistinct mobile echo densities on the leaflets .\\nthere was evidence of trace aortic regurgitation , however , due to technical difficulties , accurate gradients could not be estimated .\\nthe left ventricle was dilated , with concentric hypertrophy , and multi segmental wall motion abnormalities , with a reduced ejection fraction of 24% .\\nthere was also doppler evidence of tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary insufficiency .\\na persantine thallium scan on 3/31/93 , showed increased lung uptake ,

to the medical service , and placed at bed rest , and given intravenous furosemide .\\nover the course of the next few days , we succeeded in having his weight decrease from its value of 189 lbs , to as low as 177 1/2 lbs .\\ncoincident with this , his clinical condition improved markedly , and he became fully ambulatory .\\ngiven the difficulties in trying to assess the exact mechanism by which his heart failure had occurred , we proceeded to cardiac catheterization on 4/1/93 .\\nat the time of this study , the right atrial pressure was 1 , the pa pressure 32/10 , and the mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 10 .\\nthere was a 40-50 mm peak to peak gradient across the aortic valve , a mean gradient of 40 , and a calculated valve area of 0.5 cm squared , using a cardiac output of 3.4 liters per minute .\\nleft ventriculography demonstrated marked left ventricle dilatation .\\nthere was mild mitral regurgitation , a posterior basil aneurysm , and akinesis of the apex , septum , and inferior walls .\\nthe anterior lateral wall was severely hypokinetic , and the posterior lateral wall moderately kinetic .\\nthe aortic valve was calcified with reduced excursion consistent with his aortic stenosis .\\na dominant right coronary artery had an 80% proximal stenosis , and was then occluded at the acute margin .\\na large right ventricular marginal branch did fill the saphenous vein graft in a retrograde fashion .\\nthe posterior descending artery had an 80% stenosis proximal to the insertion of the graft .\\nthe left anterior descending was proximally occluded , and the left circumflex had a 90% stenosis in the first marginal branch , and 90% stenosis distally in other branches .\\nthe saphenous vein graft to the right ventricular acute marginal and posterior descending artery was patent with good runoff .\\nthe saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending had a minor plaque at the distal anastomosis .\\nthe saphenous vein graft to three distal marginal branches was patent with good flow .\\ncertainly , the cardiac catheterization was consistent with severe aortic stenosis in the presence of profound left ventricular systolic dysfunction .\\nthese findings were reviewed with dr. patella and together we decided that conservative therapy would be the appropriate first choice in mr. breun 's management .\\nhis advanced age , prior cardiac surgery and advanced left ventricular dysfunction , together with his chronic renal insufficiency , would certainly complicate to an enormous degree any undertaking as risky as redo surgery for aortic valve replacement .\\npercutaneous aortic valvuloplasty , on the other hand , would only be a temporary procedure and did not seem necessary even for transient symptomatic relief given his marked improvement following a rather conventional course of intravenous diuretics .\\nit is very unlikely that we will offer mr. breun aortic valve replacement surgery in the future .\\nhe seems to agree with this particular approach as the quality of life has become very important and appropriate issue for him .\\nhe is looking forward to returning home and going back to work on a part

foreign body was removed piecemeal .\\negd was performed .\\nsubsequently at the site where the chicken was stuck there was no notable trauma or lesion distal to the chicken .\\nthere was some gastritis and duodenitis but no frank ulcers .\\nthe patient was sent to the floor and gi wise was doing well until approximately 9/22/93 when he developed an ileus one day status post teeth extraction and general anesthesia .\\nthe patient also had a gi bleed at that time and an ng tube was placed with removal of 2500 cc of dark brown bilious guaiac positive fluid .\\nthe patient was stabilized with fluid and improved quickly from this status over the weekend and hct has been stable since that time .\\nother gi issues include the patient 's hypopharyngeal cancer which will be discussed below .\\n2) oncology - the patient was diagnosed prior to this admission with hypopharyngeal cancer for which he was going to undergo external radiation therapy for .\\nbecause of the multiple complications and lack of nutrition and inability of the patient to swallow without aspirating it was felt that this should be delayed until he is under better nutritional status .\\n3) feeding and nutrition - the patient was unable to eat any food or drink by mouth given that he demonstrated frank aspiration each time he attempted this including with soft solids and puree foods .\\na swallowing study was performed which clearly demonstrated frank aspiration and poor swallowing mechanism by the patient .\\nseveral ng tubes were placed and the patient kept pulling the ng tubes out because his mental status was not completely cleared .\\nthe patient was sustained on iv fluids with d10 and multivitamins , thiamine , and folate .\\nhe was kept npo given his history of aspiration and further attempts were made to fee the patient and finally as the patient 's mental status cleared he was responsive to having an ng feeding tube placed with jevity feeds started .\\nother options were considered including a peg placement as well as surgical placement of a gastrostomy tube , however , it was felt that less aggressive measures with an ng tube would be prudent at this juncture given the patient 's poor prognosis for the future .\\nthe family was involved in making decisions regarding the patient 's nutritional status and originally felt that iv fluids alone should be used , however , finally decided that some sort of feeding should be undertaken and the ng tube was the initial thought .\\nit is felt that if the ng tube does not work out the patient may need to be reassessed for potential placement of a gastrostomy tube , however , it is felt by all parties involved that the aggressive end may also present significant risk to this patient given that an operative procedure may be dangerous and patient has shown significant desaturation and uncooperativeness with his first egd on admission .\\n4) pulmonary - the patient had a clear chest x-ray other than a right lower lobe opacity consistent with scarring vs. fat pad which has been chronic on admission .\\nthe patient was saturating well throughout the initial part of the stay until he had the upper gi bleed on 9/22/93 at which time he also had significant aspiration of vomitus and was considered to have a probable aspiration pneumonia but with vague findings on chest x-ray .\\nthe chest x-ray cleared rather rapidly and on the third day post aspiration was consistent with the original admission x-ray .\\nhowever , after aspiration given that the patient had a white count bump from under 10,000 to 16,000 it was felt that he should be started on antibiotics and he was started on ceftriaxone and clindamycin for a total 10 day course for presumptive aspiration pneumonia .\\nthe patient was afebrile throughout this period and tolerated antibiotics well and pneumonia appeared to resolve .\\nno organism was ever cultured out of the sputum .\\n5) gu - the patient was not entirely responsive to using urinal or the bathroom and at times was incontinent .\\nit was thought that a foley catheter would be most appropriate and he seemed to tolerate this well .\\nhe had at one point the possibility of uti but he was asymptomatic and on rechecking the urine there was no sign of urinary tract infection .\\nthe patient continued to be asymptomatic .\\n6) neurological - the patient originally was almost completely non-responsive at least to verbal command but as his hospital course progressed he became somewhat more alert and towards the end of his hospital course was much more alert and oriented usually only times two and was difficult .\\nthe patient was much more cooperative towards the end of his stay and much more appropriate , however , he did not seem to fully comprehend the fact that he had cancer and that he would not be able to swallow things by mouth .\\nthese issues were explained to him repeatedly , however , he did not appear to comprehend them from day to day .\\npsychiatry evaluated the patient and felt that he was not competent to decide his own affairs .\\n7) social issues - the wife had obtained health proxy prior to this admission and it was felt that since the patient was not competent to make decisions on his own the wife would make decisions regarding the health status and treatment of the patient .\\nit was decided the patient 's code status would not be dnr , dni .\\n8) dental - the patient was noted to have very few teeth and it was noted that none appeared viable and it was felt that since he would be undergoing xrt in the future that his teeth should be removed to avoid radiation necrosis in the future when he received his xrt .\\nhe underwent extraction of all his teeth on 9/21/93 tolerating the procedure well initially but then developed the ileus as noted above and subsequently a gi bleed .\\nlaboratory data on discharge revealed sma 7 with sodium 134 , potassium 4.4 , chloride 103 , co2 24 , bun 5 , and creatinine 0.9 which has been stable at 0.9 to 1.0 with glucose 96 .\\ncbc revealed hct 30.7 which has been ranging from high of 29 to 31 over the last week .\\nthe white count was 7.5 , platelets 196

on 09/27/93 .\\nthe patient had a chest x-ray which showed a few right upper lobe and one left upper lobe nodule and a follow-up chest x-ray on 09/27/93 showed resolution of these previous nodular shadows .\\na faint nodule remained in the left upper lobe and it was felt that this is probably not any metastatic disease and not of concern , however , it was suggested that follow-up chest x-ray may be taken to insure that these densities resolve .\\noperative procedures: extraction of all remaining teeth under general anesthesia on 9/21/93 . complications: 1) aspiration pneumonia .\\n2) gi

dependent state left her quite depressed and ultimately a small dose of dexedrine was started partly to overcome the sedation of the opiates and perhaps improve her mood since more traditional antidepressants would take four to six weeks . plan: escalate the doses of the dexedrine perhaps up to a maximum of 10 mg at 8 o'clock in the morning and another 10 mg around noon and see if she can get reasonable sleep at night on this schedule , adding on remeron at night time for sleep as an antidepressant would be a possibility or to go right to a conventional ssri overlap until it seems to show more affect .\\nshe lives with her elderly husband and he was appropriately overwhelmed by the prospect of caring for her single-handedly , hence the transfer to a skilled nursing facility for a

occluded right coronary artery in its midportion .\\nhe had an 80% distal left main , a 90% proximal circumflex , and multiple significant lesions in the lad .\\nhis left ventricle ejection showed diffuse hypokinesis .\\nthe situation was reviewed with his wife , sligh .\\nshe noted that he was actively working full time and was a sales representative at the leigh and lives at home with her and his daughter , age 18 .\\nit was felt that , because of the evidence of congestive heart failure and the critical left main lesion , he should be admitted for further evaluation .\\nindeed , he was treated with diuretics and nitrates along with cessation of his aspirin , and he was put on iv heparin .\\nhe stabilized over the weekend .\\nhe was noted to have some ventricular ectopy on holter monitor .\\nhe developed epigastric pain on 07/31 which previously had been ignored but in retrospect was probably his anginal equivalent .\\nhe also had multifocal ventricular ectopy at that time .\\nhe had some further anterolateral st segment changes .\\ntherefore , he did have unstable angina with his critical coronary anatomy .\\nthe patient was seen in consultation by the electrophysiology service , dr. slusslashgodle , who said that he had no indication for patch placement at the time of surgery .\\non 08/02/93 , an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed ; then , dr. thorebreutz took him to the operating room , where he had quadruple coronary artery bypass grafting .\\nhe had a left internal mammary artery graft of the lad , a single saphenous vein to the right coronary artery with 280 cc per minute flow , and a saphenous vein snake graft to the diagonal and circumflex with 150 cc per minute flow .\\na paraphimosis was noted and treated by dr. ryna jescdrig .\\nafter surgery he had a ongoing sinus tachycardia .\\nhe was able to be rapidly weaned and extubated .\\nhe had good hemodynamics .\\nhe had occasional atrial and ventricular premature beats .\\nhis intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned the following day and he was transferred out of the surgical intensive care unit .\\nhe was seen in consultation by the nutrition service , who followed him for dietary management of his diabetes mellitus .\\non 08/05 it was noted that his platelet count had fallen from 171,000 to 54,000 ; this was thought to be associated with intravenous heparin and indeed , when heparin was discontinued , since it had been restarted after surgery , his platelet count rebounded to normal .\\ntherefore , he does have a thrombocytopenic reaction to heparin .\\nhe remained in normal sinus rhythm .\\nhe did have runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia , which were clinically stable .\\nhe had a right bundle branch block .\\nhe is at increased risk for future events because of his low left ventricular ejection fraction , but he is clinically stable on ace inhibitors , digoxin , coumadin , and aspirin .\\ntherefore he was able to be discharged home .\\nhe understands that he does have significant left ventricle dysfunction and requires monitoring of his prothrombin times and his arrhythmias ; these will be done in grovea co terburgperv portnew

memorial hospital of for cardiac catheterization and electrophysiology studies .\\nhis cardiac risk factors include :\\nhypercholesterolemia , hypertension and insulin dependent diabetes mellitus .\\nhe has a history of chest pain and in january 1993 underwent a cardiac catheterization at ph university of medical center which revealed an occluded right coronary artery with distal filling via left to right collaterals , a large left anterior descending with a 40-50% proximal stenosis and a co-dominant left circumflex with mild disease .\\nhe subsequently had an echocardiogram in december 1994 which showed normal left ventricular size and systolic function .\\nhe subsequently had an adenosine sestamibi in february 1997 which was negative for ischemia or infarction .\\nin december 1994 he had a paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia presenting with palpitations .\\nhe was diagnosed with wolfe parkinson white syndrome .\\nhe underwent an electrophysiology study which identified an accessory pathway with multiple attempts at ablation by dr. slusslashgodle which were unsuccessful .\\nhe was treated with sotalol for the supraventricular tachycardia .\\non 9/2/98 he was admitted to cay memorial hospital of with palpitations and was found to have an irregular wide complex tachycardia thought to be due to atrial fibrillation and conduction down his accessory pathway .\\nhe had mild congestive heart failure and was treated with an increased dose of lasix .\\nan echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of approximately 50% and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation .\\nhe was discharged home but returned on 9/13/98 with worsening palpitations on and off .\\nhe was again found to be in a wide complex tachycardia and was treated with magnesium .\\nhe denied any associated chest pain or dyspnea and he ruled out for a myocardial infarction .\\nhe continued to have intermittent runs of the wide complex tachycardia and was therefore transferred to ph university of medical center for further evaluation and management .\\nprior to transfer he did have one episode of chest pain during the night without electrocardiogram changes . past medical history:

also a question of an allergy to prednisone which he said causes eye swelling .\\nhowever , the details of this are quite uncertain and it is not clear if this was a true allergy . physical exam: he was comfortable with a blood pressure of 156/78 , pulse 56 and respirations of 16 .\\nhis lungs were clear throughout .\\nhis apical impulse was nondisplaced with a regular rate and rhythm , normal s1 and s2 but not s3 or s4 .\\nthere was a grade 1/6 holosystolic murmur at the lower left sternal border radiating to the apex .\\ncarotid pulses were 2+ bilaterally and there was no jugular venous distention .\\nhis abdomen was benign .\\nfemoral pulses were 2+ bilaterally without bruits and he had pedal edema bilaterally . laboratory data: bun 18 , creatinine 1.8 , magnesium 1.5 , cholesterol

delay consistent with wolf parkinson white syndrome .\\nthere were also nonspecific st-t wave abnormalities . hospital course and treatment: the patient clearly was suffering from atrial arrhythmias conducting down his bypass tract which were difficult to manage and causing symptomatic palpitations .\\ngiven his known coronary artery disease and his recent heart failure and chest pain a cardiac catheterization was indicated prior to proceeding to an electrophysiology study .\\nhis initial cardiac catheterization had to be postponed given the possibility of an allergy to prednisone .\\nhe was seen by nnoatal hospital center who felt that he could be safely treated with solumedrol rather than prednisone together with benadryl and the use of low ionic contrast medium .\\naccordingly the patient underwent uneventful cardiac catheterization on 9/17/98 which revealed a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 25 and a left ventricular end diastolic pressure of 20 .\\nhis right coronary artery was occluded and filled distally via left to right collaterals .\\nhe had a 50% proximal left anterior descending stenosis and only minor disease to the left circumflex .\\nhis left ventriculogram showed preserved systolic function and mild mitral regurgitation .\\nthe patient then underwent an electrophysiology study on 9/20/98 .\\nthere was no inducible supraventricular tachycardia but he did have evidence of a left lateral bypass tract .\\nmapping of the mitral anulus confirmed the location of the bypass tract .\\nradiofrequency ablation was applied there and resulted in the elimination of the preoperatively-excitation .\\nthere were no complications .\\nfollowing the procedure there was no further evidence of wide complex tachycardia .\\nhe still did have occasional short runs of atrial tachycardia but there were no associated palpitations .\\nin following up his ablation he underwent a holter monitor which showed normal sinus rhythm at rates of 40 to 80 .\\nthere were 15 atrial runs the longest of which was 13 beats at a rate of 100 .\\nhe also underwent a post-procedural echocardiogram which showed an ejection fraction of 61% with mild mitral regurgitation and left atrial enlargement at 45mm .\\nfollowing the procedure his qt interval was noted to be prolonged to approximately .55 seconds .\\nhis sotalol was therefore decreased to 120 mg bid and his qt and qtc intervals decreased to .45-.48 seconds .\\nafter the procedure he was started on heparin and loaded on coumadin for a period of the next 3-4 weeks following radiofrequency ablation .\\nhis inr was 2.3 prior to discharge and he was scheduled to follow-up with the anticoagulation clinic to follow his coumadin dose .\\nfinally , his dementia appeared to worsen following receiving medications for agitation during his ep study .\\naccordingly he was seen by neurology who felt that there was no evidence of a secondary process .\\nhe did have a head ct which showed no evidence of a bleed or stroke .\\nfinally , his blood pressure had trended up during his hospitalization particularly with the decreased dose of sotalol .\\ngiven his occasional sinus bradycardia his atenolol was not advanced but instead his zestril dose was increased from 10-20 mg bid and his blood pressure responded appropriately . condition on discharge: he was discharged in stable condition on

heparinized as the scabeth t hospital surgery team had already done and that coumadinization be begun within a few days of heparinization .\\nthese recommendations were already underway .\\nconsequently we simply continued our management .\\nthe cardiology consult also spoke to the patient 's primary medical doctor , dr. blood in clear la who related that the patient had had two large esophageal ulcers and a history of polycythemia vera in the past .\\non 5-30-92 the patient 's gastroenterologist dr. ri blood was contacted .\\ndr. blood was on vacation , however dr. kotethorereke , his partner was in the office and went through mr. flytheleungfyfe 's old chart and noted that dr. blood had performed esophagogastroduodenoscopy on the patient during his north

discussed coumadinization with dr. blood and noting dr. blood 's earlier findings we , in conjunction with dr. blood decided to coumadinize the patient and coumadinization was begun on 5-30-92 .\\nit was noted at that time that a stable dose for the patient earlier when he had been coumadinized before was 5 mg. po q.day .\\nthat was concurrent with albuterol 150 mg. po q.day .\\ngiven the patient 's history of ulcer and hiatus hernia and the fact that we did wish to anticoagulate the patient we actually performed upper endoscopy on the patient on 5-31-92 .\\nthe findings were as follows .\\nthe principal operating surgeon was dr. ca scgach with the assistance of dr. jesclinke .\\nthe principal findings were a 5.0 cm. hiatal hernia and apparent ingree and ot of weamanshy medical

duodenum .\\nthe overall impression was that there was an apparent healed esophageal ulcer , a hiatus hernia , an esophageal mucosal changes distally were consistent with a barrett 's esophagus .\\nno biopsy was taken .\\nthe biopsy was deferred because the patient had received a dose of coumadin the night before and had a prothrombin time of approximately 15 before the procedure .\\non 6-1-92 the patient went to the echocardiography suite .\\nfindings were :\\nthere was no evidence of intracardiac thrombus , although this was a transcardiac echocardiogram which is not the best technique for visualizing intraatrial thrombus .\\nthere was a thickened mitral leaflet with mild mitral regurgitation .\\nthere was focal calcification in the mitral annulus .\\nthe aortic leaflets were thickened

insufficiency with right ventricular systolic blood pressure of 35 millimeters .\\nthere was paradoxical septal motion consistent with bundle branch block .\\nthe patient , it should be noted at this time , was doing very well and he was taking regular diet , voiding spontaneously .\\nhe had been therapeutically heparinized since going to the operating room and by 6-2-92 his prothrombin time was beginning to elevate .\\non 6-2-92 he presented a new complaint with left wrist swelling and pain .\\nhe confessed to a history of gout in the past and consequently rheumatology consult was obtained .\\nthe rheumatologist entertained gout as an attractive diagnosis given his history and they aspirated the joint .\\njoint aspirate was remarkable for calcium phosphate crystals , that is the patient actually had a case of pseudo-gout .\\njoint aspirate that was sent for culture has been negative to date and today is 6-4-92 .\\nthe rheumatologist recommended checking a wrist xray to rule out calcification .\\na wrist xray was obtained of the left wrist and it did show chondrocalcinosis thus confirming the diagnosis of pseudo-gout .\\nthe patient 's pseudogout was treated with colchicine 0.6 mg. po q. 3 hours and he received nine such doses over a time span of about 42 hours with some relief of his symptoms .\\nhe is being discharged on colchicine 0.6 mg. po t.i.d. as an acute measure for his pseudo-gout and that prescription will last until he sees dr. blood in follow up this coming tuesday .\\ntoday , on 6-4-92 , the patient has no new complaint .\\nyesterday , on 6-3-92 , his prothrombin time was just a bit over 16 , between 16 and 17 and consequently his heparin was discontinued .\\ntoday his prothrombin time is 16.7 and it looks like 5 mg. of coumadin per day is going to be a stable dose for him .\\nconsequently , he is ready for discharge today .\\nthe only other thing of note is that secondary to his anticoagulation with coumadin his ecotrin has been discontinued .

.\\nthe chemotherapy was well tolerated but did result in febrile neutropenia .\\ngranulocyte colony stimulating factor was added .\\nthus white blood count dropped to 0.6 minimum on 8-27 , with platelet count of 63,000 but with granulocyte colony stimulating factor support and antibiotics for febrile neutropenia , white blood count recovered .\\nactually the lowest white blood count was 0.5 on 8-31-93 .\\non that occasion , platelet count was as low as 17,000 .\\nby 9-8-93 , the white blood count was back up to 16.2 .\\nthe patient 's course was complicated by severe pain and intractable nausea and vomiting and severe substernal pain .\\nhe is on ms contin and also on duragesic patch .\\nhe continued to have nausea and vomiting .\\nthe patient was seen in consultation by dr. signs of gastroenterology .\\neventually , a picc line was inserted and he was given central total parenteral nutrition because of severe anorexia during radiation therapy .\\ntwo weeks passed without a bowel movement because of the lack of intake and eventually that resolved .\\nit was felt that endoscopy would be of value .\\na central venous line was placed on 8-29-93 .\\nafter neutropenia resolved by 9-2-93 with white blood count rising to 2.2 and platelet count to 28,000 , endoscopy became feasible .\\nthis was done on 9-4-93 and there were inflammatory exudates , ulcerations , and granulation tissue in the middle and distal third of the esophagus , but the tumor polypoid masses had completely disappeared .\\ncytologic brushings of the ulcerated areas were positive for cancer cells but deep biopsies were negative .\\nthe patient was treated with fluconazole in case there was any monilia , although biopsy did not confirm the presence of monilia .\\ngradually during the hospitalization , the sternal pain improved , as did the pain in the left hip and the patient became able to ambulate somewhat .\\nhe was making progress and accordingly , a second course of chemotherapy was given at lower dose .\\nhe received vp-16 100 mg daily x three , 9-12 , 9-13 and 9-14-93 , and cisplatin 40 mg daily x three on that same date with zofran 10 mg.\\nthe only problem was some recurrent nausea .\\nthe radiation therapy was finally finished on the day of discharge , 9-19-93 , at which point the patient was able to take fluids and food but was still occasionally vomiting .\\nhis white blood count was in the range of 53,000 because neupogen had been started with his second cycle of chemotherapy and will be continued until it is clear that he has passed the nadir of any neutropenia to be expected from this cycle of chemotherapy . discharge diagnosis: 1. metastatic small cell cancer of esophageal origin to liver and bone ,\\n2. severe ulcerations of the esophagus at sites of prior

and unfortunately a smaller lesion 1cm was seen separately adjacent and medial to the biceps tendon near the brachial neurovascular bundle .\\nan magnetic resonance imaging scan which was performed three months prior to admission to brook hospital for resection demonstrated that this more medial lesion was not present at that time and therefore it was suspicious for metastatic melanoma .\\nthe

airway obstruction , hypopotassemia , cellulitis , orbital hemorrhage , protein calorie malnutrition , gastrointestinal hemorrhage , pulmonary hemorrhage / pneumonia , hyperglycemia , renal insufficiency , hyperuricemia , hypophosphatemia . history of present illness: this 75 year old male had been noted to be anemic with an abnormal white blood count since at least november 1993 , while he was living in aersing rocuch sun and his physicians there had begun to manage him with transfusions , and low dose hydroxyurea .\\napparently , a bone marrow biopsy at the time confirmed the diagnosis of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia .\\nhe came to this country in late december 1994 to live with his son for a few months and was referred to me for follow up .\\nhe had been noting night sweats , increasing fatigue , anorexia , and dyspnea , which were not particularly improved by increased transfusions or alterations of hydroxy urea .\\nhe became profoundly thrombocytopenic , and ultimately was admitted to the hospital on 2/15 with headache and weakness . past medical history: significant for chronic atrial fibrillation , managed with an italian variation of digoxin , and amioadrone , hypertension managed with an ace inhibitor , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease managed with a zanthine preparation and low dose steroids , as well as an occasional inhaler .\\nother medical problems included chronic liver disease of uncertain etiology , for which he had been advised not to drink any alcohol .\\nhe also had a penetrating injury to the right eye , which had rendered him blind 10 years previously . physical examination: he was a chronically ill appearing elderly man , with a respiratory rate of 30 , temperature 99.6 , pulse 100 , and irregularly irregular , blood pressure 148/71 .\\nhe had some petechiae on his extremities , as well as in his mucosal membranes with some hemorrhagic bullae .\\nthere were bibasilar rales with some wheezing .\\nhe had no cardiac murmur .\\nhis abdomen was distended with massive hepatosplenomegaly , which was somewhat tender .\\nthe neurological examination aside from the blind right eye was unremarkable . laboratory data: included a white blood count of 140,000 , 7% polys , 1% bands , 3% lymphs , 1% monos , 2 basos , 4 blasts , 76% pearl monocytes , 6% meta 's , 3 nucleated red blood cells .\\nthere were some

or masses .\\nthere was cardiomegaly with prominent vascularity , but no effusions .\\nan electrocardiogram was consistent with atrial fibrillation . hospital course: the patient was admitted to the hospital and begun on high dose hydroxyurea , with a gradual improvement in his white blood count over the next few days .\\nhe did spike a fever and began ancef and gentamicin , although cultures never revealed a source for this .\\nhe also tried amicar and continued on low dose prednisone .\\nhis headache improved , but her remained profoundly weak and intermittently febrile with dyspnea .\\nthere was hemoptysis and intermittent gastrointestinal bleeding , while he remained profoundly thrombocytopenia .\\ntransfusions of platelets did not change his platelet count , presumably because of sequestration and a massive spleen .\\namicar was of uncertain value , but used intermittently .\\na bone marrow biopsy revealed the transformation of his cmml to acute myelogenous leukemia , and given his other underlying medical problems , we chose chemotherapy with subcutaneous cystosine arabinoside and 6-thioguanine , which he tolerated without incident and this brought his white blood count down to below 1,000 , and his spleen shrank noticeably , but he still could not maintain a bump in platelet count with platelet transfusions .\\nhe was intermittently congested limiting our ability to give intravenous fluid , for his hydrea , although we kept him on allopurinol .\\nthe renal function deteriorated somewhat , hampering our ability to give him his gentamicin .\\nthe family maintained an extraordinary vigil over the days of his hospitalization , providing him with some food and constant attention , while we awaited the results of his chemotherapy and treatment of his infection .\\nhe was intermittently restless and somewhat confused , and as his respiratory status deteriorated , the family agreed to a low dose morphine drip which made him much more comfortable
